**Some services are not meant for serverless but they are used extensively like DynamoDB.** Also, when we say these are the services that we will be using does not mean these are the only services available. There might be few that can be added in the future too. Since the servers are ephemeral, the data should not be. So a simple storage solution would be to store in S3.

+ Amazon API Gateway
+ Amazon DynamoDB
+ Amazon EventBridge
+ Amazon Kinesis
+ Amazon S3
+ Amazon SNS
+ Amazon SQS
+ AWS Lambda
+ AWS Step Functions
+ Aurora RDS
+ AWS Amplify


You can start by getting to know these services and what their functionality is. We can glue them together depending on our use case and tada, the system is ready.
