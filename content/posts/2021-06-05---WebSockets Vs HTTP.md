**HTTP is a request-response based stateless protocol while websocket features bi-directional, full-duplex communication over a persistent TCP connection.** Http does not maintain state. Each request and response happens between the client and server happens without any knowledge on the previous exchange it happened between them. WebSocket works on a persistent connection.
